Ms. you need to download JMF (java media framework) from here: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/download-142937.html

to play songs click on all songs and for all records click on albums and artist. To import the package on my project right click on my project, than click properties, than libraries than add jar files. Oh and i have provided the test.mpg to test.


HI, I have 2 buttons, one button is All songs and one is Albums and Artist. All songs will allow the user to browse the songs and they will be able to choose only mp3, mpg or wav files and once the file is in the JList select the song and click play to play the song. Now for the second button, the second button is will allow to prompt another window which will ask user to enter the records, for example artist name, song name, albumm, length. The user can also have benefits to find the record too by simply click the find mp3 button.
